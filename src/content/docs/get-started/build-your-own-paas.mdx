**Transform your Kubernetes cluster into a full-fledged PaaS with Edka.**

This guide demonstrates how to configure a selection of add-ons to enhance your Edka cluster. You can choose to install any add-ons according to your needs, either through the Edka dashboard, GitOps, or directly via the Kubernetes cluster API.

For this example, we'll cover:
- Installing essential add-ons (ingress, certificates, database operator, secrets management).
- Configuring these add-ons.
- Integrating with external services like a secrets provider, GitHub account and a container registry.
- Enabling GitOps for continuous reconciliation.

## Prerequisites

- An Edka cluster (previously created). If you didn't create one yet, see our [Create Your First Cluster](/get-started/create-a-cluster/) guide.
- One or more domain names that you own and can configure DNS records to point to your cluster ingress endpoint.

## 1. Install Add-Ons
Start by navigating to **Settings** in your cluster overview, then go to the **Add-ons** section.

Edka provides a curated set of production ready add-ons that can be installed on your cluster. For this guide, install the following:
<Steps>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <strong>Ingress Controller</strong>
         <p>An Ingress controller is required to expose your applications to the internet.</p>
         <p>It automatically provisions a load balancer from your cloud provider and configures the necessary rules to route traffic to your applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Certificate Management</strong>
         <p>It integrates with your Ingress Controller to automatically provision and renew TLS certificates for your applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Certificate Issuer</strong>
         <p>This is required to communicate with the provider for your certificates, in this example Let's Encrypt, but you can configure other issuers directly on your Kubernetes cluster. Cert Manager add-on is required for this to work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Cloud Native Postgres</strong>
         <p>This is a PostgreSQL operator that automates the provisioning and management of PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. It covers the full lifecycle of a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster with a primary/standby architecture, using native streaming replication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>External Secrets</strong>
         <p>This add-on allows you to sync secrets from external providers into your Kubernetes cluster. It supports a wide range of providers, including AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Doppler, and more.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
</Steps>


## 2. Customize Your Add-Ons
Some add-ons require additional configuration. While we are working to automate this, some manual steps are currently needed.

### Ingress Controller
Point one or more domain/subdomain DNS records to your cluster's ingress endpoint. You can find this endpoint in the cluster overview, under **Ingress Endpoints**.

### External Secrets
To allow your cluster to fetch secrets from an external provider (this example uses [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/)), create a secret in your cluster with the provider's credentials. This can be done through the Edka dashboard and referenced in GitOps later.

In your cluster's **Settings**, navigate to **Secrets** and create a new secret with the following values:

- **Name**: *doppler-token-auth-api*
- **Namespace**: *external-secrets*
- **Key**: *dopplerToken*
- **Value** *your-doppler-token*

Press **Create Secret** to save the secret.

![External Secrets](https://assets.edka.io/ek_secret_store.webp)
The ClusterSecretsStore will use this secret to authenticate with Doppler and fetch secrets for your projects.

In the blueprint repository, [edkadigital/blueprint](https://github.com/edkadigital/blueprint/blob/main/clusters/resources/clusterone/secrets/cluster-secrets-store.yaml) you can find the configuration for the secrets store. You can also create your own secrets store configuration and reference it in your GitOps repository.

### Cloud Native Postgres
This add-on requires several credentials for your PostgreSQL database cluster. The blueprint repository is configured to fetch secrets with the following names from Doppler. You will need to create these in your Doppler project:

- **Bootstrap Database Credentials:**
  - `POSTGRES_USER`
  - `POSTGRES_USER_PASSWORD`
- **Cluster SuperUser Credentials:**
  - `POSTGRES_SUPERUSER`
  - `POSTGRES_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- **AWS S3 Credentials (for database backups):**
  - `ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`

The blueprint repository is configured to automatically use these Doppler secrets to create the necessary Kubernetes secrets in your cluster.

## 3. Enable GitOps
Enable continuous reconciliation for your applications and cluster resources. Our initial release supports GitHub repositories, with other providers planned for future updates.

#### GitHub Integration
First, integrate with GitHub by navigating to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub**. Grant permissions to the repositories you plan to use.
![GitHub](https://assets.edka.io/ek_github.webp)
#### GitOps Configuration
Once permissions are granted, go to your cluster's **Settings** > **GitOps**. Select the repository and branch for GitOps.

![GitOps](https://assets.edka.io/ek_gitops.webp)

In this example we connect [edkadigital/blueprint](https://github.com/edkadigital/blueprint) repository to the cluster, which provides a blueprint for the cluster and add-ons configuration. You can inspect the GitOps reconciliation status in the cluster, using `kubectl` command line tool or Lens IDE.

```bash
$ kubectl get kustomizations --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE     NAME                    AGE     READY   STATUS
flux-system   cluster-secrets-store   9m23s   True    Applied revision: refs/heads/main@sha1:c97b810d9d8d0ffc5f70c80a23fe252e7bf13bc7
flux-system   flux-system             9m29s   True    Applied revision: refs/heads/main@sha1:c97b810d9d8d0ffc5f70c80a23fe252e7bf13bc7
flux-system   postgres-cluster        9m23s   True    Applied revision: refs/heads/main@sha1:c97b810d9d8d0ffc5f70c80a23fe252e7bf13bc7
flux-system   shared-components       9m23s   True    Applied revision: refs/heads/main@sha1:c97b810d9d8d0ffc5f70c80a23fe252e7bf13bc7
```

## 4. Connect a Container Registry
Edka supports several container registries, including GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and Google Artifact Registry. This example uses GitHub Container Registry.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Registry** and select your container registry. Follow the specific instructions for your chosen registry to connect it to your cluster.
