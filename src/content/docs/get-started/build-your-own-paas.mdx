**Transform your Kubernetes cluster into a full-fledged PaaS with Edka.**

This guide uses a specific set of add-ons to demomnstrate the process. You can choose to install any add-ons you like, according to your needs, either through the Edka dashboard, GitOps or directly through your Kubernetes cluster API.

For this example, we'll configure:
- an ingress controller to expose your applications to the internet
- a certificate management to automatically provision and renew TLS certificates
- a database operator to manage PostgreSQL databases with high availability, backups and point-in-time recovery from AWS S3
- a secrets management add-on to sync secrets from an external providers into your Kubernetes cluster and avoid hardcoding secrets in your Git repositories
- integratrion with an external container registry to enable automatic image pull/push for your workloads
- a GitOps add-on ([FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io)) to enable continuous reconciliation (GitOps) for your applications and other cluster resources from a Git repository

## Workflow
- Install the add-ons from your cluster settings
- Provide extra configurations for the add-ons to work with your cluster
- Sync your secrets from an external provider into your Kubernetes cluster
- Connect a Git repository to enable continuous reconciliation (GitOps)
- Connect a container registry to enable automatic image pull/push for your workloads

## Prerequisites

- A Edka cluster (previously created). If you didn't create one yet, see our [Create Your First Cluster](/get-started/create-a-cluster/) guide.
- One or more domain names that you own and can configure DNS records to point to your cluster.

## Install Add-ons
In your cluster overview, navigate to **Setting** > **Add-ons**

Edka provides a curated set of production add-ons that can be installed on your cluster.
<Steps>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <strong>Ingress Controller</strong>
         <p>An Ingress controller is required to expose your applications to the internet.</p>
         <p>It automatically provisions a load balancer from your cloud provider and configures the necessary rules to route traffic to your applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Certificate Management</strong>
         <p>It integrates with your Ingress Controller to automatically provision and renew TLS certificates for your applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Certificate Issuer</strong>
         <p>This is required to communicate with the provider for your certificates, in this example Let's Encrypt, but you can configure other issuers directly on your Kubernets cluster. Cert Manager add-on is required for this to work.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Cloud Native Postgres</strong>
         <p>This is a PostgreSQL operator that automates the provisioning and management of PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes. It covers the full lifecycle of a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster with a primary/standby architecture, using native streaming replication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>External Secrets</strong>
         <p>This add-on allows you to sync secrets from external providers into your Kubernetes cluster. It supports a wide range of providers, including AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Doppler, and more.</p>
      </li>
   </ol>
</Steps>


## Customize Your Add-ons
Some add-ons require additional configuration to work properly. Currently, there are some manual steps, but we're working on automating this process in the near future.

### Ingress Controller
Ingress controller only requires one or more domain/subdomain to be pointed to the ingress endpoint. You can see your ingress endpoint in the cluster overview, under **Ingress Endpoints**.

### External Secrets
To allow your cluster to fetch secrets from an external provider, you need to create a secret in your cluster with the credentials for your external provider. This can be done through the Edka dashboard and referenced in GitOps later.

*Note: this example uses [Dopppler](https://www.doppler.com/) as the external secrets provider, but you can use any other supported provider.*

Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets** and create a new secret with the following values:

- **Cecret Name**: *doppler-token-auth-api*
- **Namespace**: *external-secrets*
- **Key**: *dopplerToken*
- **Value** *your-doppler-token*

Press **Create Secret** to save the secret.

## Enable GitOps
Continuous reconciliation for your applications and other cluster resources. Our first release only supports GitHub repositories, but we're working on adding support for other providers soon after.

#### GitHub Integration
To enable GitOps, you first have to integrate it with GitHub and grant permissions to one or more repositories you plan to use. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **GitHub** and grant permissions to your repositories.

#### GitOps Configuration
Once you have granted permissions to your repositories, navigate to your cluster **Settings** > **GitOps** and select the repository and branch you want to use for GitOps.

## Connect a container registry
Edka supports several container registries, including GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and Google Artifact Registry. In this example, we'll use GitHub Container Registry.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Registry** and select your container registry from the list. Follow the instructions specific to your registry to connect it to your cluster.
